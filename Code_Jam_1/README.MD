Went to the student search website, search.pclub.in/api/students and then searched for random person. After inspecting(ctrl+shift+i) the page, found a students.json file. Copied it. Used the file in the code and designed a GUI that takes blood group with RH factor as input. And finds the mail id of all the persons that can donate blood to that particular blood group by a **simple linear search**, time complexity **O(n)** For ex, if searched for B- blood group, the mail is sent to people with blood groups B- and O-, as they both can donate to B- person. Search Database is just a checking feature that prints all eligible mail ids.
